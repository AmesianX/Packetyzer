## Abstract

*	Packetyzer is a high level library for C++ designed to make easier the forging and decoding of 
	network packets. It has the ability to decode packets of most common network protocols, capture 
	them and send them on the wire. This capability allows construction of tools that can probe, scan 
	or attack networks.

*	It enables the creation of networking tools in a few lines. A packet is described by its protocol 
	layer type where fields of each layer have useful default values that you can overload. It has the 
	ability to analyze pcap files or captured packets using Wireshark. 

*	Packetyzer has the ability to capture packets, analyze them and send them over the wire. It analyzes 
	the packets and the connection streams ... from the Ethernet header to the Application layer protocols. 
	Packetyzer is in the form of Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that will help to be included in many tools 
	and projects.

## Previous work

Scapy :  Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks, written in Python by Philippe Biondi.
It can forge or decode packets, send them on the wire, capture them, and match requests and replies. It 
can also handle tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks, and network discovery.

Scapy provides a Python interface into libpcap, (Winpcap on Windows), in a similar way to that in which 
Wireshark provides a view and capture GUI. It can interface with a number of other programs to provide 
visualization including Wireshark for decoding packets, GnuPlot for providing graphs, graphviz or 
VPython for visualization, etc.

## What is new ?

*	Raw packets are represented as array of cPacket class where each packet is analyzed carefully. 
	cPacket is the main packet representation used in Packetyzer.
	
*	Packets are feed to packet stack by cPcapFile “using a pcap file” , cPacketGen “generating raw packets” 
	or cWinpcapCapture “capturing network packets”, where this stack is analyzed and is represented as a 
	Traffic structure “by cTraffic class”.

*	cTraffic is responsible to analyze packets of the same session and add the related packets by 
	their protocol types as Streams which are composed of IP protocols “cConStream” and non-IP protocols 
	“cARPStream & ICMPStream”. cConstream analyze TCP and UDP protocols then the application layer 
	protocols are decoded into their related Streams “like cHTTPStream”.

## Features

*	It has the ability to decode:
	Ethernet, ARP, IP, IP options, IGMP, ICMP, TCP, TCP options, UDP, DNS and HTTP

*	The cPacket class is an abstract class designed to manage the data structure of any packet, 
	which is the base of all protocols implemented in Packetyzer. All the classes derived from the
	cPacket class have a set of common methods as following:

>*	Each packet is decoded according its own protocol type.
>*	Packet checksum and TTL are checked to detect if the packet I forged.
>*	Every packet is split into different headers according to its layered protocols starting to Ethernet 
	protocol until the application layer protocol.
>*	Packetyzer it has the ability to recalculate the checksum and correct it in the actual packet.
>*	UDP & TCP data sizes are calculated and their data are parsed out into Character pointers to be used 
	later, Also TCP and IP options are parsed out.

*	Connection streams separation where packets of the same session are extracted and stored into stream 
	class arrays. 
	Supported streams are: IP Streams, ARP Streams, ICMP Streams, TCP Streams and UDP Streams as 
	protocols and it also analyze DNS Streams and HTTP Streams as application layer protocols.

*	The ability to reassemble TCP Segments and get data buffer from the packets reassembly.
	It can be used to extract files from capture files sent or received through HTTP protocol for example.

*	Packetyzer can capture packets using Winpcap library and sort each group according to its type in 
	a cTraffic structure.

*	Sending raw packets on the wire that have been captured or generated by cPacketGen.

*	A Packet Generator that can generate different types of packets. It has powerful options to 
	manipulate and craft specific packets.

## To-Do List

*	Enhancing TCP Reassembler to be more intelligent.
*	Implementing SLL , IPv6, IPv6 Options Decoders.
*	Adding Layered Service Provider class.
